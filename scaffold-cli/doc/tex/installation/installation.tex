\section{Installing \sh}
\sh is written completely in Java and deployed in a runnable JAR file.
Therefore no installation is required to run the application.
Simply download the \sh ZIP archive from the website and extract it somewhere on your computer (e.g., in case you
have admin rights, \verb+C:\Program Files\ScaffoldHunter+ on Windows or \verb+/opt/scaffoldhunter+ on Unix/Linux/Mac,
or alternatively in any local directory).

\hintbox{Important}{A Java Virtual Machine must be installed on your computer. For large datasets and better overall performance, the installation of a \mysql Database is recommended. See \secref{sec:scaffoldhunter:requirements:jvm} for further information.}

\section{Installing Plugins}
If you need to install additional plugins that are not bundled with \sh, you have to copy the plugin's JAR file to the \texttt{plugins} subdirectory of the \sh installation directory.
